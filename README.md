This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart when iterating over lists. The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from incorrectly using the `<=` operator in the loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an element beyond the list's bounds. This can result in an exception at runtime. The solution uses the `<` operator to correctly iterate within the bounds of the list.
